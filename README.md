# ev-excel-analytics

This repository contains a curated collection of advanced Excel tools used for 
operational analytics, forecasting, downtime calculations, incident classification,
DNS diagnostics, address similarity comparison, and workflow automation.

These files were developed for real-world service operations and field support 
environments, using:

- Complex formulas (nested logic, matrix formulas, lookups)
- Macros (VBA automation)
- Controlled data models
- Scenario-driven calculations for operational KPIs

Each folder includes:

- The original Excel file (`.xlsx` or `.xlsm`)
- A short README explaining the purpose, logic, and technical complexity

This repository complements the Python automation and SQL analytics from:

- `ev-kpi-factory`
- `ev-sql-toolkit`
- `ev-airtable-webhooks`
